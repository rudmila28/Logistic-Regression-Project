## Determining User Response on Web Ad using Logistic Regression
**Background of the Project:**
This project aims to determine user response towards a particular web ad. I have been provided with a large dataset of websiteâ€™s visitors demographic, geographic and behavioral attributes. My task was to build a model that will predict whether or not users will click on that ad based on their features.

**Work Process:**
I have collected the data of 1000 website visitors. After that, I have imported necessary python libraries. Using those libraries, I have performed an exploratory data analysis on the data through various visual representations. Then I have split the data into train and test sets. After training the model, I have conducted Logistic Regression which eventually helped me to evaluate the model and predict the test data. Finally, I have determined the accuracy of that model.

**Result:**
By analyzing data, evaluating the model, I have created a classification report to determine the accuracy of the model. This model can be implemented in future projects with such results. 

*Note: The website information and the dataset are confidential. I have only shown the data analysis process.*
